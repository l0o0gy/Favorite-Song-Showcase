# Favorite-Song-Showcase

create a web application that allows users to share their favorite song by submitting details about the song, including its name, a link to the song on youtube, a brief description of why it's their favorite, and the year they first listened to it.

the application will then display this information along with an embedded youtube video of the song on the same page.
